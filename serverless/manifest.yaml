# Wskdeploy manifest for openwhisk-cloudant-trigger
# GitHub repo is located at https://github.com/IBM/openwhisk-cloudant-trigger
# Installing openwhisk actions, triggers, and rules for OpenWhisk building block - Cloudant Trigger

# Deployment using this manifest file creates following OpenWhisk components:
#   Package:    cloud-object-storage
#   Package:    $PACKAGE_NAME
#   Action:     $PACKAGE_NAME/parse_trigger.js
#   Action:     $PACKAGE_NAME/call_processing_functions.js
#   Action:     $PACKAGE_NAME/image_processing_gray.js
#   Action:     $PACKAGE_NAME/image_processing_vr.js
#   Sequence:   $PACKAGE_NAME/imagesequence
#   Sequence:   $PACKAGE_NAME/grayandwrite
#   Sequence:   $PACKAGE_NAME/vrandwrite
#   Trigger:    $TRIGGER_NAME
#   Rule:       $RULE_NAME

# This manifest file reads following env. variables:
#   PACKAGE_NAME
#   RULE_NAME
#   TRIGGER_NAME
#   BUCKET_NAME
#   ENDPOINT (cos endpoint for your buckets)
#   API_KEY (watson visual recognition)
#   VERSION (watson visual recognition version)
